![Database schema diagram](static/images/DB_SCHEMA.jpeg)

## Architectural Consideration
1. The ```full_code``` of the ```DiagnosisCode``` Model is simply the ```category code``` and the ```code``` of the ```DiagnosisCode``` Model concatenated. The ```full_code``` is populated with the data of these two fields automatically and saved into the database.

2. Each DiagnosisCode object has a category field which is foreign key relating to th CategoryCode Model, The Category Model provides the categoryTitle and categoryCode fields for the DiagnosisCode Model

## Setup Instructions
To run this project
1. Clone project
2. Build and run docker container with a single command: docker-compose up â€”build


## Migration and Populating the database with initial data
Open a new terminal and run:
```
docker ps
docker exec -it <CONTAINER_NAME> bash
python manage.py makemigrations api_v1
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py loaddata diagnosis_code_data.json
```
